Let's be intentional about trying to write regularly.  What things do I want to try and write about?

* remote work
* React
* Javascript
* DevOps (currently going through a big move at work to AWS and utlizing Istio/Envoy)

My goal is to publish something once a week.  I had an old site hosted on Github.com but TBH, I never did much with it.  Maybe I'll try to convert that Jekyll content over to this Gatsby site, though the world will probably not be a lesser place if that content stays where it's at.  

As I mention above, I'm currently involved in a big project at work moving services over to AWS, a common deployment pipeline, and potentially being a point person on deploying Envoy into our existing microservices.
